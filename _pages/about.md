I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Kansas State University, focusing on artificial intelligence, machine learning, bioinformatics, and information retrieval. I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Bilkent University and my B.Sc. in Information Technology Engineering from the University of Tabriz. My experience includes research and teaching assistant roles, and I have published works on data stream classification and ensemble learning.
